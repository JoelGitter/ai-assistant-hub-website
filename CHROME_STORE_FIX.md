# Chrome Web Store Rejection Fix

## Issue
The Chrome extension was rejected by the Chrome Web Store with the following violation:

**Violation Reference ID:** Purple Potassium  
**Violation:** Requesting but not using the following permission(s): `scripting`  
**Relevant Policy:** Request access to the narrowest permissions necessary to implement your Product's features or services. Don't attempt to "future proof" your Product by requesting a permission that might benefit services or features that have not yet been implemented.

## Root Cause
The `manifest.json` file was requesting the `scripting` permission but the extension code was not actually using it anywhere. This violates Chrome's policy of only requesting permissions that are actively used.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Unused Permission
- **Removed:** `"scripting"` permission from manifest.json
- **Reason:** The extension code does not use `chrome.scripting` API anywhere

### 2. Added Missing Permission
- **Added:** `"tabs"` permission to manifest.json
- **Reason:** The extension uses `chrome.tabs.query()` and `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()` in popup.js

### 3. Removed Unused Permission
- **Removed:** `"activeTab"` permission from manifest.json
- **Reason:** The extension code does not use `chrome.activeTab` API anywhere

## Final Permissions
```json
"permissions": [
  "storage",
  "tabs"
]
```

## What Each Permission Is Used For

### `storage`
- **Usage:** Extensively used throughout the extension
- **Examples:** 
  - Storing user authentication tokens
  - Saving user preferences (formality levels, notification settings)
  - Managing assistant visibility state
  - Storing encrypted data

### `tabs`
- **Usage:** Used in popup.js for communication with content scripts
- **Examples:**
  - `chrome.tabs.query()` - Finding the currently active tab
  - `chrome.tabs.sendMessage()` - Sending messages to content scripts

## Files Modified
- `manifest.json` - Updated permissions array

## Testing Required
After making these changes, test the following functionality:
1. ✅ Form filling still works
2. ✅ Page summarization still works
3. ✅ Assistant visibility toggle works
4. ✅ Notification settings work
5. ✅ Authentication flow works
6. ✅ Storage operations work

## Chrome Web Store Resubmission
1. Update the extension version number if needed
2. Package the extension with the corrected manifest.json
3. Resubmit to Chrome Web Store
4. The rejection should be resolved as all requested permissions are now actively used

## Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Only request permissions you actually use** - Don't "future proof" with unused permissions
2. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure all functionality works with minimal permissions
3. **Document permission usage** - Keep track of which permissions are used where
4. **Regular audits** - Periodically review permissions and remove unused ones

## Permission Usage Map
```
storage: content.js, popup.js, security.js
tabs: popup.js (for content script communication)
```
